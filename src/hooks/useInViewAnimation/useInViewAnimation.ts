/**
 * Implements scroll-driven animations using `react-spring`.
 *
 * @param component element that will be animated (div, h2, etc)
 * @param animation the type of animation that will be triggered
 * @returns
 *
 * `ref`: place on the element that should trigger the animation once in view
 *
 * `animatedStyles`: place on the `AnimatedComponent`
 *
 * `AnimatedComponent`: a variation of the passed `component` that is compatible with `react-spring`
 *
 * `isInView`: a boolean value that is `true` while the `ref` element is in view and AppState is `ready` (allows you to add additional custom animations)
