# My Portfolio Website
This website is live and hosted at https://westonvincze.com.

All art and code was designed and developed by me. This website outlines my path into the development world and showcases my portfolio of web apps and games. It was created using NextJS, TypeScript, XState, and React-Spring, designed using Figma, and hosted on Vercel.

Merging into main triggers Vercel's autodeploy pipeline.
